# Simplex Method Linear Programming

## Input
The examples are text files because this allows users to input problems without having to put in the effort of creating some strange matrix, which they might not understand. 
Also, the inputs are intentionally not very consistent with spaces because this is what is bound to happen when used.
Examples can be found in the examples folder.
### Form
The first line is the formula which is to be maximized. variables start with letters (e.e., x, y, x2, ...).
